		<div> I'm a native New Yorker with a passion for local organic produce, and a love of entertaining. Growing up in a musical household, our doors were always open for friends and family coming through with songs and stories to share at our dining room table.

For as long as I can remember, the nick name 'Rabbit' has followed from childhood, through college, and into my kitchen. My appreciation for fresh seasonal ingredients has grown while working with organic farms in upstate New York and researching plant based nutrition. This curiosity, fueled by a love of beautiful ingredients and my personal health journey, lead me to collect my favorite foods and seasonal recipes. Whether you're a budding rabbit, or a fellow enthusiast, I hope you'll join me as I step into the wild side of edible plants and the culinary adventures they have in store.</div>
